                The visualisation is to show the top performaing universities in the world 
                so that they can be compared when students are deciding where to attend to 
                complete their degree. We will look at the university breakdown globally 
                and then break this down to the top performing universities in the world.
                <br><br>
                Below we can see a world map showing the countries where the top universities 
                in the world reside, as well as the amount of international students from other 
                countries that study in the particular country <span class="special_text">per 10,000 population</span>.
                <br><br>
                <span class="special_text">Click on the buttons below</span> to see the map shoing the faculty counts for these same 
                universities. Can you see the comparisons from both maps? What countries have 
                the biggest changes from students to faculty?
                <br><br>
                Below if the breakdown of the <span class="special_text">student to faculty ratio</span> for each country so we 
                can see the disparity between countries. From this bar chart, we can see that 
                the average rartio is roughly 14, which means there are approximately <span class="special_text">14 students</span> 
                for every faculty memeber at univerisites in these countries. However, there are 
                some major outliers with countries like Syria and Morocco having a much larger ratio.

                Here we can see the top ranked univeristies in the world. We can see that most of them 
                resisde in the US with <span class="special_text">60%</span> of the top 10 universities based in <span class="special_text">America</span>. We also have 
                the likes of <span class="special_text">England</span> and <span class="special_text">Switzerland</span> appearing in the top ranked universities. <span class="special_text">Massachusetts 
                    Institute of Technology (MIT)</span> has stayed at number 1 for the last 5 years which shows its 
                prestige and high calibre student output. This year the <span class="special_text">University of Oxford</span> moved 3 places 
                from last year to 2nd in the top 10 showing its strong improvement, as well as <span class="special_text">University of 
                    Cambridge</span> which moved from 7th to 3rd, showing that <span class="special_text">England's</span> university standards have 
                increased phenomenally over the last year.

                Here we can see the score distribution the top 10 univerisities. As expected <span class="special_text">MIT</span> have led 
                the world with a perfect score for the last 5 years. We can also the the massive increase 
                of the <span class="special_text">University of Oxford</span> scores which led to them jumping to the number 2 spot this year. 
                The biggest discrpency of the scores if from the <span class="special_text">Univeristy of Cambridge, Imperial College 
                    London</span> and <span class="special_text">University of Oxford</span>. This shows that <span class="special_text">England's</span> education standards increased 
                substantially in the last 5 yeards comparatively to other countries.

                Here we can see the distribution of university sizes, taking all the universities in the world
                and grouping them into sizes. It is evident that almost half of thw worlds universities are 
                considered <span class="special_text">large</span> (meaing they contain more than <span class="special_text">12,000</span> students, but less than <span class="special_text">30,000</span>). <span class="special_text">Medium</span> 
                (greater than <span class="special_text">5,000</span> students, but less than <span class="special_text">12,000</span> students) and <span class="special_text">Extra large</span> (greater than <span class="special_text">30,000</span> students) 
                sized universities are quite similar in distibution. <span class="special_text">Small</span> universities (Less than <span class="special_text">5,000</span> students) 
                are not very common accross the world meaining it may be hard for these facilities to run with a 
                low student count.
